        <h1>Building Your City Service: Introduction</h1>
<p>Hey there, awesome city developer! ðŸ‘‹</p>
<p>So you've designed your API contract in the previous exercise - congrats! Now comes the fun part: bringing your service to life with some actual code. This is where API-first really shines because you already have a clear roadmap of what you're building.</p>
<h2>What This Exercise Is All About</h2>
<p>In this exercise, we're going to implement your city service based on the API contract you created. Whether you're building a Police Department, Fire Station, Power Plant, or any other city service, the process will be similar. We'll use TypeScript and Express to create a robust, well-structured service that follows modern development practices.</p>
<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
<p>By the time you finish this exercise, you'll be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a TypeScript service that perfectly implements your OpenAPI specification</li>
<li>Use middleware to automatically validate requests and responses against your contract</li>
<li>Structure your code in a clean, maintainable way using layers (controllers, services, repositories)</li>
<li>Connect your service to the city service registry so others can discover it</li>
<li>Test that your implementation matches your API contract exactly</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why API-First Makes Implementation Easier</h2>
<p>When you follow the API-first approach, implementation becomes so much more straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your API contract serves as your roadmap</strong> - no more wondering what endpoints you need or what data structures should look like</li>
<li><strong>Request and response validation happens automatically</strong> - the OpenAPI validator will ensure your implementation matches your contract</li>
<li><strong>You focus on business logic, not API structure</strong> - the &quot;what&quot; is already decided, so you can focus on the &quot;how&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Other teams can integrate with your service immediately</strong> - they already know your API from the contract</li>
<li><strong>Changes are more controlled</strong> - if you need to modify something, you update the contract first, then the implementation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tools We'll Be Using</h2>
<p>For this implementation, we'll use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TypeScript</strong> - For type safety and better developer experience</li>
<li><strong>Express.js</strong> - A lightweight web framework for Node.js</li>
<li><strong>express-openapi-validator</strong> - To validate requests and responses against your OpenAPI spec</li>
<li><strong>Node.js</strong> - Our runtime environment</li>
<li><strong>In-memory storage</strong> - For simplicity (in a real app, you'd use a database)</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Quick Overview of What We'll Build</h2>
<p>Here's the high-level structure we'll create:</p>
<pre><code>services/your-service-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ openapi.yaml         # Your API specification
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/              # TypeScript interfaces matching your API schemas
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/        # Data access layer (simulated with in-memory storage)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/            # Business logic layer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/         # API endpoint handlers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/          # Express middleware (validation, error handling)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts             # Main application file
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json             # Dependencies and scripts
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json            # TypeScript configuration
</code></pre>

</ul>
<h1>Structure of assignments</h1>
<p>Start with short explanation of Story Mapping: - A flow of functionality, achieving a goal - Overview - Slices and planning - API first: - The first slices are <em>easy</em>: resource, base (CRUD) actions - Flow for single services is simple, over multiple services is becomes more interesting</p>
<p>In the 'Features' section for each individual service below, the type of assignment is reference between square brackets &quot;[1]&quot;. Mostly, there will be overlap and people will naturally go through different elements as they start story mapping and we will guide them through different types of implementations. If that doesn't happen, the specific assignments should trigger it.</p>
<h2>Assignment type 1: Make a map with different situations for direct use of the service</h2>
<p>Learning Goal: Understanding the domain, understanding the split over different services, API first
Use: make it clear what can be done with the base service in isolation, document functionality and align with engineering
But: Will not necessarily <em>drive</em> implementation, as engineers get that by just implementing base actions on resource
Merge: Walk through stories with engineering, verify it's implemented as expected</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Do merge here, or after second level?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h2>Assignment type 2: When we have a broader goal, actually coming from a user, it gets more intersting. Integration within POD</h2>
<p>Learning Goal: Slices, Iterative delivery, integration
Use: Actual end-user functionality/goals, finding small slices to plan, drive new implementation</p>
<p>Merge: talk through slices with engineering, trigger next steps in implementation</p>
<p>[Another explanation: example mapping intro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business rules and 'acceptance criteria'</li>
<li>Examples</li>
<li>Formulating examples to Scenarios</li>
<li>Normally done with the whole team...
]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assignment type 3: More complicated functionality where you need to define the logic</h2>
<p>Learning Goal: Example Mapping, Examples/Scenarios, going into detail
Use: Specify 'complicated' business rules</p>
<p>Merge: Talk through examples with engineering, trigger tests and implementation</p>
<h2>Assignment type 4: Integrations that can be asynchronous, guaranteed delivery, pub/sub</h2>
<p>Learning Goal: Broadcasting changes in state that are useful to potentially different interested parties
Use: Use pub/sub to ensure information will be received, but not care about speed or response</p>
<p>Merge: discuss functionality with engineering, trigger use of pub/sub</p>
<h2>Assignment type 5: Gravitee and the Graph</h2>
<p>Learning Goal: Some functionality is non-functional, technology and architecture are impacted by NFRs
Use: Limited bandwidth can mean less room for many API calls, implement limited base functionality while allowing deeper functionality when full bandwidth is available</p>
<p>Merge: discuss non-functional requirement with engineering, trigger use of Gravitee GraphQL facade</p>
<h2>Assignment type 6: Scheduling</h2>
<p>Learning goal: Dealing with recurring jobs and events
Use: Some things need to be done on a recurring cadence, either from business needs (finance reporting) or functional ones (recurring events), which is triggering specific workflow in a different way</p>
<p>Merge: discuss recurring triggers with engineering, trigger use of scheduled jobs</p>
